terms:
  # Core VSA Concepts
  - term: VSA
    full: Vector Symbolic Architecture
    alias: [HDC, Hyperdimensional Computing]
    definition: Computing paradigm using high-dimensional vectors for distributed representations
    context: Embeddenator uses sparse ternary VSA for filesystem encoding
    
  - term: Engram
    definition: Holographic representation of a filesystem consisting of root hypervector + codebook + manifest
    components: [root_vector, codebook, manifest]
    context: Core data structure for storing encoded filesystems
    
  - term: SparseVec
    definition: Sparse ternary vector with {-1, 0, +1} values stored as positive and negative index lists
    struct: "SparseVec { pos: Vec<usize>, neg: Vec<usize> }"
    location: src/vsa.rs
    
  - term: Bundle
    symbol: "⊕"
    operation: Associative superposition via element-wise addition with normalization
    property: Creates set-like combinations of vectors
    method: SparseVec::bundle(&self, other: &SparseVec)
    
  - term: Bind
    symbol: "⊙"
    operation: Non-commutative composition via element-wise multiplication
    property: Self-inverse (A ⊙ A ≈ I)
    method: SparseVec::bind(&self, other: &SparseVec)
    use_case: Associate role-filler pairs (e.g., path ⊙ content)
    
  - term: Permutation
    symbol: "ρ"
    operation: Cyclic shift for sequence/order encoding
    property: Orthogonalizes noise across levels
    status: TO_IMPLEMENT
    
  - term: Cosine_Similarity
    definition: Dot product normalized by magnitudes, returns [-1, 1]
    threshold_match: ">0.75"
    threshold_noise: "<0.3"
    method: SparseVec::cosine(&self, other: &SparseVec)
    
  - term: Codebook
    definition: HashMap mapping chunk IDs to original data bytes
    purpose: Enables bit-perfect reconstruction after VSA indexing
    storage: Encoded chunks with integrity vectors
    
  - term: Manifest
    definition: JSON metadata describing filesystem hierarchy, paths, chunk IDs
    purpose: Guides reconstruction by ordering chunks correctly
    extension_needed: Nested format for multi-level engrams
    
  - term: Crosstalk
    definition: Interference noise from superposed non-zeros in bundled vectors
    cause: Accumulates with bundle size
    mitigation: [high_dimensionality, sparsity, cleanup, resonators]
    
  - term: Cleanup
    definition: Post-unbinding query against codebook to find closest match
    algorithm: Cosine similarity search, select highest match > threshold
    guarantees: Bit-perfect if signal > noise
    
  - term: Resonator_Network
    definition: Iterative refinement algorithm for factoring deeply bound compounds
    algorithm: Project partial unbinds onto item memories, threshold to ternary, iterate
    convergence: Typically <10 iterations
    depth_support: 20-30+ hierarchy levels at D=10,000
    status: TO_IMPLEMENT
    
  - term: CDT
    full: Context-Dependent Thinning
    definition: Probabilistic dropout to preserve sparsity during bundle/bind
    purpose: Prevent noise escalation from density growth
    status: TO_IMPLEMENT
    
  - term: Adaptive_Sparsity
    definition: Keep S·D constant as dimensionality increases
    formula: "sparsity = target_non_zero / dimensionality"
    example: "D=100K, S=0.2% → 200 non-zero (same as D=10K, S=2%)"
    benefit: No computational cost increase with higher dimensions
    status: TO_IMPLEMENT
    
  # Architecture Terms
  - term: EmbrFS
    definition: Holographic filesystem implementation in Embeddenator
    location: src/embrfs.rs
    operations: [ingest, extract, query]
    
  - term: Hierarchical_Encoding
    definition: Multi-level engram structure for TB+ scale data
    structure: "Leaf → Directory → Root bundles with ≤1000 items per level"
    benefit: Distributes noise across levels
    status: TO_IMPLEMENT
    
  - term: FUSE
    full: Filesystem in Userspace
    crate: fuser
    purpose: Mount engrams for on-demand read access
    status: TO_IMPLEMENT
